    <h2>The University of Virginia</h2>
    <br>


    The University of Virginia (UVA) is a public research university in
    Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1819 by Thomas
    Jefferson and contains his Academical Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
    The original governing Board of Visitors included three U.S. presidents:
    Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, the latter as sitting president of
    the United States at the time of its foundation. As its first two rectors,
    Presidents Jefferson and Madison played key roles in the university's
    foundation, with Jefferson designing both the original courses of study and
    the university's architecture. Located within its historic 1,135-acre
    central campus, the university is composed of eight undergraduate and three
    professional schools: the School of Law, the Darden School of Business, and
    the School of Medicine.[10]

    The University of Virginia's scholars have played a major role in the
    development of many academic disciplines, including economics,[c] law,[d]
    literary art,[e] visual art,[f] and the sciences.[11] The university is
    referred to as a "Public Ivy" for offering an academic experience similar
    to that of an Ivy League university. Admission to the university is highly
    selective, with a 16.2 percent acceptance rate for the Class of 2027,[12]
    and the university is known in part for its historic foundations,
    student-run honor code, and secret societies.[13][14][15]

    In research, the university has been a member of the Association of
    American Universities for 120 years, and the journal Science credited its
    faculty with two of the top ten global scientific breakthroughs in a single
    year.[11] In sports, the university athletic teams are called the Cavaliers
    and lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in team NCAA Championships for men's
    sports, also ranking second in women's and overall titles. In 2015, and
    again in 2019, the University of Virginia was presented with the Capital
    One Cup for fielding the nation's best overall athletics programs for men's
    sports.[16][17]

    The university's alumni, faculty, and researchers have included several
    U.S. presidents, heads of state, Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners,
    Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, and Fulbright Scholars. Some 30
    different governors of U.S. states have attended the university, as have
    numerous U.S. senators and members of Congress. UVA has produced 56 Rhodes
    Scholars, eighth most in the United States, while its alumni have founded
    companies such as Reddit, CNET, VMware, and Space Adventures.
